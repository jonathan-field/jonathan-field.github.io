# Swingsouls
This calculator will determine how many light and heavy one-handed/two-handed attacks you can perform in Dark Souls with the added bonus of letting you know whether you can one-hand or two-hand the weapon. Just input your stats and enable the Ring of Favor and Protection if you have it equipped!

## Why?
Often times when I made builds, I wanted to know how many swings I could perform with all the different weapons in the game given my stats. This is useful for knowing how many swings you can pull off in the event you stunlock an opponent. Knowing which weapon that will let you have more swings is useful to know when speedrunning bosses and maxing out DPS. Also [others in the past](https://www.reddit.com/r/darksouls/comments/8cn4dw/does_anyone_have_a_staminaperswing_calculatortable/) asked about calculators for this sort of thing and I couldn't find anything on it so I created it myself.

## Languages Used
This is a website so naturally I have used HTML and CSS to create it but since it is also a calculator the webpage needed to be able to update dynamically based off user input. Therefore, I opted for JavaScript to implement the stats required for each weapon, the weapon's total stamina consumption for both one-handed and two-handed attacks, and the user's stats. Using all this information I created functions to accurately display the correct amount of swings the user can do depending on what attack was being made.

Yes this webpage is not completely done yet and is in testing stage. Although it is quite near completion, only need to fix some CSS. If you're seeing this then welcome!
